# Quick VPN with Yandex Cloud

## What is it?

## How to prepare?

1. Set up Yandex Cloud account.
2. Configure the [billing account in Yandex Cloud](https://console.cloud.yandex.ru/billing/create-account).
3. Install [yc](https://cloud.yandex.com/en/docs/cli/quickstart).
4. Restart your shell to make `yc` command available.
5. Configure `yc` by calling `yc init`.
6. [Install Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) on the device where you want to use VPN.
7. Ensure you have an SSH-key generated, with public key saved as `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.
8. Download [do.sh](./do.sh) and run it, following the on-screen instructions.
9. Check that the server was removed from [Yandex Cloud](https://console.cloud.yandex.ru/).

By default the command will generate a wireguard config for 1 client, using the
subnet `192.168.55.0/24`. You can override the defaults by calling the script
with the arguments: `./do.sh 10 10.0.0` â€” this will generate config for 10
clients with subnet `10.0.0.0/24`.

Below is the example produced by this script (so you'll know what to look for in
the output):

```ini
[Interface]
Address = 10.10.10.2/24
DNS = 8.8.8.8
PrivateKey = cGiXg4D1SHlvyxqRCeuwxXil9UeMgdfw4WqqNwvZ+ls=

[Peer]
PublicKey = WtPF2qWwDlGSjfo0SJu3kr6FeB/csBXBmD+L72/j8mc=
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
Endpoint = 62.84.2.1:43517
PersistentKeepalive = 30
```

You need to add this config into your wireguard client and activate the connection.
